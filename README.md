# 🚀 LearningParashar24: My Software Development Learning Path

Welcome to my personal knowledge hub and curated learning path for my software development career! This repository is a living document, constantly updated with valuable resources, notes, code snippets, and documentation across various domains of software engineering.

## ✨ Purpose & Vision

The goal of this repository is to:

* **Organize my Learning:** Centralize all links, articles, tutorials, and personal notes related to my ongoing learning.
* **Easy Access:** Serve as a quick reference for revisiting concepts and finding essential resources.
* **Share Knowledge:** Potentially offer insights and resources to others on similar learning journeys.

## 🗺️ How It's Organized

This repository is structured to provide a logical flow through different software development domains and their sub-topics.

The main entry point is the **[Home Page](https://ishanparashar24.github.io/learningparashar24/)**, which acts as an index.

Here's a high-level overview of the folder structure:

```

your-repo-name/
├── index.html                      
├── ai/                             
│   └── index.html
├── machine-learning/               
│   └── index.html
├── android-development/            
│   ├── index.html                  
│   ├── jetpack-compose/            
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── xml-layouts/                
│   │   └── index.html
│   └── kotlin-android/             
│       └── index.html
├── future-tech/                    
│   └── index.html
├── assets/                         
│   ├── pdfs/
│   └── images/
└── README.md                       <-- You are here!

```

* **Domain Folders (e.g., `ai/`, `android-development/`):** Each major domain has its own directory.
* **Domain `index.html`:** Inside each domain folder, an `index.html` file provides an introduction to that domain and links to its sub-topics.
* **Sub-topic Folders (e.g., `jetpack-compose/`):** Specific technologies or areas within a domain have their own folders.
* **Sub-topic `index.html`:** These files are where you'll find direct links to resources, your personal notes, and references to downloadable documents (like PDFs).

## 📖 My Workflow

* **To Add New Resources:**
    1.  I navigate to the relevant domain/sub-topic folder (or create a new one if needed).
    2.  Open or create an `index.html` file.
    3.  Add new links, notes, or embed information directly into the HTML.
    4.  If adding PDFs or images, place them in the `assets/pdfs/` or `assets/images/` folders and link them relatively.
    5.  Commit my changes and push.
* **To Add New Domains/Sub-topics:**
    1.  I create a new folder for the domain/sub-topic.
    2.  Add an `index.html` file within that folder
    3.  Update the parent `index.html` page (e.g., the main `index.html` for new domains, or the `android-development/index.html` for new Android sub-topics) to include a link to your new page.
